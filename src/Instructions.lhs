Creating the map
----------------

  The road is where you start; its long desc is now famous, having been
  quoted by Steven Levy in his book Hackers.

  The instructions here say that if you want to go west, or up, or on the
  road, we take you to hill ; if you want to go east, or in, or to the
  house, or if you say 'enter', we take you to house ; etc. Of course you
  won't know about all the motions available at this point until you have
  played the game for awhile.

  Nothing up the hill, but a good explorer has to try anyway.

>   MakeLoc L.Hill
>       "You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back\n\

  The house initially contains several objects: keys, food, a bottle, and a
  lantern. We'll put them in there later.

  Two magic words are understood in this house, for spelunkers who have been
  there and done that.

>   MakeLoc L.House

  A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. (Emerson)

>        MakeInst [Depression] Always (To Outside)],

  The instructions here keep you in the forest with probability 50%,
  otherwise they take you to the woods . This gives the illusion that we
  maintain more state information about you than we really do.

>   MakeLoc Forest
>       "You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side."

>        MakeInst [Woods,S] Always (To Forest)],

  You're getting closer. (But the program has forgotten that `Depression`
  leads outside; it knew this when you were at the road or the valley .)

>   MakeLoc L.Slit
>       "At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit\n\
>        \in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock."
>       (Just "You're at slit in streambed.")

  We'll see later that the Grate will change from state 0 to state 1 if
  you unlock it. So let's hope you have the Keys.

>   MakeLoc Outside

  If you've come this far, you're probably hooked, although your adventure
  has barely begun.

  To the left or south of the misty threshold, you might spot the first treasure.

  Unless you take a circuitous route to the other side of the Hall of
  Mists, via the Hall of the Mountain King, you should make the CRYSTAL

  What you see here isn't exactly what you get; N takes you east and S sucks
  you in to an amazing maze.

>   MakeLoc Wmist
>       "You are at the west end of the Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl\n\

  The twisty little passages of this maze are said to be all alike, but they
  respond differently to  different motions. For example, you  can go north,
  east, south, or west from Like1,  but you can't go north from Like2 .  In
  that way  you can psych out the  whole maze of 14  similar locations. (And
  eventually  you will  want to  know every  place where  treasure  might be
  hidden.) The only exits are to wmist and brink .

  Recall that the last instruction above means, "Dwarves not
  permitted." It keeps them out of the following maze, which is based on an
  11 Ã— 11 latin square. (Each of the eleven locations leads to each of the
  others under the ten motions N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW, U, D â€” except
  that diff0 goes down to the entrance location wlong instead of to diff10,
  and diff10 goes south to the dead-end location pony instead of to diff0.
  Furthermore, each location is accessible from all ten possible
  directions.)  Incidentally, if you ever get into a "little twisting maze
  of passages," you're really lost.

  Going north of the long hall, we come to the vicinity of another large
  room, with royal treasures nearby.  (You probably first reached this part
  of the cavern from the east, via the Hall of Mists.) Unfortunately, a
  vicious snake is here too; the conditional instructions for getting past
  the snake are worthy of study.

  Will Crowther,  who actively  explored and mapped  many caves  in Kentucky
  before inventing Adventure, named  Bedquilt after the Bedquilt Entrance to
  Colossal Cave. (The real Colossal Cave was discovered near Mammoth Cave in
  1895, and its Bedquilt Entrance was found in 1896; see The Longest Cave by
  Brucker and Watson  (New York: Knopf, 1976) for  further details.)  Random

  When the current location is crack or higher, it's a pseudo-location. In
  such cases we don't ask you for input; we assume that you have told us to
  force another instruction through. For example, if you try to go through
  the crack by the small pit in the upper cave (location Spit ), the
  instruction there sends you to crack, which immediately sends you back to
  Spit .

 #define forced move (loc ) (loc â‰¥ min forced loc )
 #define Force 0

  Here are some forced actions that are less pleasant.

>   MakeLoc Neck
>       "You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck." Nothing []
>       [MakeInst [Force] Always (To Limbo)],

>   MakeLoc Lose

  The rest are more-or-less routine, except for check -- which executes a
  conditional forced command.

  The table of instructions ends here; the remaining "locations" Ppass,
  pdrop, and troll are special.
